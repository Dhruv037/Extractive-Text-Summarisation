# Extractive Text Summarisation using Naive Bayes classifier
Document extracts consist of nearly 20% of the original document and at the same time can be as informative as the full text of the original document. In this project, we propose a solution to deal with this problem using Supervised Learning techniques. Our first goal was to achieve features that uniquely identify the sentences that make their way to the summary. The features can be categorised as surface, content, and relevance features. Surface features are related to the structure and position of a sentence in the document. Content features are related to the amount of content related information being conveyed by the sentence. Relevance features are based on the relevance of each sentence with respect to other sentences of a document. We used the above features and applied Supervised Learning techniques on them, where each sentence of a document is considered as a data point and the label for a corresponding data point describe whether the data point is present in the document summary. The summaries generated are evaluated using ROUGE. We observed that the relevance features improved the overall performance of our summarization task.
